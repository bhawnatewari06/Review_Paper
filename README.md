This paper concludes that Machine learning (ML) algorithms applied in tracking and 
forecasting diabetes has demonstrated promise in recent 
years. To recognise people having diabetes, machine learning 
(ML) can analyse information about patients, enabling an 
earlier diagnosis and improved disease treatment. This study 
reviews and assesses a variety of cutting-edge methods for 
predicting and detecting diabetes. In order to identify 
diabetes early, supervised learning methods, including Nave Bayes, SVM, and decision trees, have been used. In this area, 
decision trees have demonstrated promise, and combining 
them with unsupervised methods like PCA and K-Mean can 
increase prediction precision and accuracy. Additionally 
showing promise in effectively recognising and analysing 
diabetes are K-Mean and SVM. Furthermore, deep learning based algorithms like ANN and CNN can improve diabetic 
patient outcomes.
